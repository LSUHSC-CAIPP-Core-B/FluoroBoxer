# Data preprocessing
Everything conected to working with the dataset.

## Cell Adjustor
`cell_image_adjustor_marplot.py`   
Script to preview cell images and check the output of each step of preprocessing. You can also change params of preprocessing to adjust the cell mask and label creation accuracy.  

**How to use:**
You need to provide *dataset path* in *config.py* to iterate over. To adjust params change the sliders. To keep current configuration press the save button and params will be stored in *params.csv* with the date of the save. Next and back button move through iamges but you can use random button to pick different image. Reset button resets current params to initial ones that were used on opening the app.   

## Labeling
`label_cell_images.ipynb`    
Iterate over images in the provided directory and for each image crop part of it to gen mask and label (yolo format).
We cover the whole image while croping. The Crop params and path might need to be adjusted for different datasets to match iamge size and desired overlap of crops.

`get_background_images.ipynb`   
Use this to get background images that do not contain dead cells. It does the exact same process that the previous scrip does but instead of getting the images with prediction, it looks for the empty ones.

## Augumentation
`augument_cell_iamges.ipynb`   
Augumentations are only a change in brightness and contrast. We augument images, labels, masks at the same time.

## Spliting
`split_dataset.ipynb`   
Split augumented files into train, val, and test parts.

## Labels formats etc.
`yolo_to_xml.py` and `xml_to_tfrecord.py`   
Theese files change the format of labels to needed formats (xml, tfrecord).
Specific params and paths might have to be adjusted depending on the dataset.
   
`change_yolo_class_num.py`   
Script to change yolo class numbers in label files.   

## Visualization
`box_rand_images.ipynb`   
Notbeook to visualise random images with bounding boxes.   

## CellProcessor
File with variety of functions used along all the data processing. Functions are used exactly for labeling, reading images, converting labels and general visualization.
